/**
 * Home Router Component.
 * This component represents the home route.
 * The meaning of this component is to be the main component associated to the current route (we can call it as "Home Page" for example).
 * The router components are responsible for accessing any info related to the routing,
 * and then pass them to the real component displayed in the page.
 * Do not provide any additional info or rendering here. Do that in the Home Component instead.
 * @export
 * @class HomeRouter
